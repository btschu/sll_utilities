## Contains

Add a method contains(value) to your SLL class, which is given a value as a parameter.  Return a boolean (true/false); true, if the list possesses a node that contains the provided value.

```
 class SLL {
    // constructor, other methods, removed for brevity
    contains(value) {
    	// is "value" to be found anywhere in this list?
    }
 }
```

## Length

Create a new SLL method length() that returns number of nodes in that list.

```
 class SLL {
    // constructor, other methods, removed for brevity
    length() {
    	// how many nodes are in my list?
    }
 }
 ```

## Display

Create display() that returns a string containing all list values. Build what you wish console.log(myList) did!

```
 class SLL {
    // constructor, other methods, removed for brevity
    display() {
    	// neatly display nodes in my list
    }
```

## Move

### SList: Move Min to Front

Create a standalone function that locates the minimum value in a linked list, and moves that node to the front of the list. Return the new list, with all nodes still present, and all (except for the new head node) in their original order.

### SList: Move Max to Back

Create a standalone function that locates the maximum value in a linked list, and moves that node to the back of the list. Return the new list, with all nodes still present, and all in their original order except for the node you moved to the end of the singly linked list.
